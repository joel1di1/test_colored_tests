This project show how my tests are always finiching by 
  0 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
when adding redgreen.


To test this (and maybe try to find a fix):
> git clone git://github.com/joel1di1/test_colored_tests.git
> cd test_colored_tests
> bundle install
> rake db:migrate
> rake test

the last line is '0 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors'

If you comment the redgreen gem in the Gemfile, then 'rake test', the last line is :
  7 tests, 10 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
